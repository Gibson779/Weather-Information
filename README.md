# Weather-Information
My Weather App 

The code is designed to fetch and display weather information for different cities using the Weather API from RapidAPI. It makes initial fetch requests for a set of predefined cities and provides a form where users can enter a city name to get its weather information. The getdata function handles making the API request and updating the webpage with the retrieved weather data.
